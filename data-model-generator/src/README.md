# DataModelGenerator
---

### Approach
1. **Class Initialization**: The class will initialize necessary components like Faker for generating fake data and set a random seed for reproducibility.
2. **Data Model Creation**: A method will generate an Excel file with predefined tables, columns, and relationships.
3. **Data Model Loading**: Another method will load the data model from the Excel file into the class instance.
4. **Query Generation**: A method will generate synthetic SQL queries using the loaded data model, considering the number of joins and conditions specified.
5. **Dataset Generation**: This method will generate a dataset of synthetic queries, split into input and output parts for each query.


### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The `DataModelGenerator` class initializes with a seed for reproducibility and sets up Faker for generating fake data.
- **Data Model Creation**: The `create_sample_data_model` method generates an Excel file with predefined tables, columns, and relationships.
- **Data Model Loading**: The `load_data_model` method reads the Excel file and validates its structure, storing it in the instance.
- **Query Generation**: The `generate_synthetic_query` method constructs SQL queries based on the data model, including joins and conditions.
- **Dataset Generation**: The `generate_dataset` method creates a dataset by splitting each query into input (initial part) and output (remaining part) to facilitate training models for query completion or generation tasks.

This approach ensures that the data model and query generation are encapsulated within a reusable class, making it easy to generate synthetic datasets for various purposes.
