## DataModelGenerator Class
---

### Approach
1. **Class Initialization**: The class will initialize necessary components like Faker for generating fake data and set a random seed for reproducibility.
2. **Data Model Creation**: A method will generate an Excel file with predefined tables, columns, and relationships.
3. **Data Model Loading**: Another method will load the data model from the Excel file into the class instance.
4. **Query Generation**: A method will generate synthetic SQL queries using the loaded data model, considering the number of joins and conditions specified.
5. **Dataset Generation**: This method will generate a dataset of synthetic queries, split into input and output parts for each query.


### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The `DataModelGenerator` class initializes with a seed for reproducibility and sets up Faker for generating fake data.
- **Data Model Creation**: The `create_sample_data_model` method generates an Excel file with predefined tables, columns, and relationships.
- **Data Model Loading**: The `load_data_model` method reads the Excel file and validates its structure, storing it in the instance.
- **Query Generation**: The `generate_synthetic_query` method constructs SQL queries based on the data model, including joins and conditions.
- **Dataset Generation**: The `generate_dataset` method creates a dataset by splitting each query into input (initial part) and output (remaining part) to facilitate training models for query completion or generation tasks.

### Example Generated Query:
```sql
SELECT customer_id, name
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
WHERE customers.name LIKE '%smith%' 
  AND orders.order_date BETWEEN '2021-03-15' AND '2023-08-22';
```

### Features:
1. **Realistic Data Generation**:
   - Numeric ranges based on column types
   - Realistic date ranges
   - Context-aware string patterns

2. **Query Complexity Control**:
   - `num_joins`: Control number of JOIN clauses
   - `num_conditions`: Control WHERE clause complexity

3. **Data Model Awareness**:
   - Respects primary/foreign key relationships
   - Follows table/column data types
   - Maintains referential integrity

4. **Variety Generation**:
   - Multiple JOIN types ('', LEFT)
   - Different comparison operators
   - Various condition patterns (LIKE, IN, BETWEEN)

## SQLRougeL Class
---

### Approach
1. **Class Definition**: Create a class `SQLRougeL` that will contain all the necessary methods.
2. **Helper Methods**:
   - **Tokenization**: Convert SQL queries into tokens using regular expressions to identify SQL keywords, identifiers, operators, and punctuation.
   - **LCS Calculation**: Compute the length of the longest common subsequence between two token lists using dynamic programming.
3. **Main Method**: Calculate the ROUGE-L-SQL score by utilizing the tokenizer and LCS functions to determine precision, recall, and F1 score between a generated SQL query and a reference query.


### Explanation
1. **Class Initialization**: The `SQLRougeL` class is defined without an initializer since no instance variables are needed.
2. **Static Methods**:
   - `_sql_tokenizer`: Converts an SQL query into a list of tokens by normalizing the query and using regular expressions to identify SQL components.
   - `_lcs`: Uses dynamic programming to compute the length of the longest common subsequence between two lists of tokens.
3. **Main Method**:
   - `rouge_l_sql`: Takes two SQL queries (generated and reference), tokenizes them, computes the LCS length, and calculates precision, recall, and F1 score to return the ROUGE-L-SQL metrics.
