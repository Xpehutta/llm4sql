### 1. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**

#### Mathematical Description:
- LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by adding low-rank matrices to the original weight matrices of the model.
- Let $W \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d} $ be the original weight matrix of a layer in the pre-trained model.
- LoRA introduces two small matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r} $ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times d} $, where $r \ll d $ is the rank of the decomposition.
- The updated weight matrix becomes:
  $$
  W_{\text{new}} = W + AB
  $$
- During fine-tuning, only $A $ and $B $ are updated, while $W $ remains frozen. This reduces the number of trainable parameters from $d^2 $ to $2dr $, which is much smaller when $r \ll d $.

#### Why It Works Well:
- By updating only the low-rank matrices $A $ and $B $, LoRA minimizes catastrophic forgetting of the pre-trained knowledge while adapting the model to the new task.
- The scaling factor $\alpha $ (e.g., `lora_alpha` in the code) controls the impact of the LoRA updates:
  $$
  W_{\text{new}} = W + \frac{\alpha}{r} AB
  $$
  This ensures that the updates are appropriately scaled for the task.

### 2. **Dataset and Tokenization**

#### Mathematical Description:
- The dataset consists of input-output pairs, where each pair is tokenized using the tokenizer.
- Let $x $ be the input text and $y $ be the output text.
- The full text is constructed as $z = x \to y $, where $\to $ is a separator token.
- The tokenizer converts $z $ into token IDs:
  $$
  z_{\text{tokens}} = \text{Tokenizer}(z)
  $$
- Padding and truncation ensure that all sequences have the same length $L $:
  $$
  z_{\text{padded}} = \text{PadOrTruncate}(z_{\text{tokens}}, L)
  $$

#### Why It Works Well:
- Using a consistent sequence length $L $ simplifies batch processing and ensures compatibility with the model's input requirements.
- The separator token $\to $ provides a clear boundary between the input and output, helping the model understand the task structure.

### 3. **Training Loop**

#### Mathematical Description:
- The training loop minimizes the loss function $\mathcal{L}(\theta) $, where $\theta $ represents the trainable parameters (i.e., $A $ and $B $ in LoRA).
- For each batch $\mathcal{B} $, the loss is computed as:
  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{B}}(\theta) = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{B}|} \sum_{(x, y) \in \mathcal{B}} \ell(x, y; \theta)
  $$
  where $\ell(x, y; \theta) $ is the per-sample loss (e.g., cross-entropy loss for language modeling).
- Gradients are computed using backpropagation:
  $$
  \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{B}}(\theta)
  $$
- Parameters are updated using AdamW optimization:
  $$
  \theta \leftarrow \theta - \eta \cdot \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{B}}(\theta)
  $$
  where $\eta $ is the learning rate.

#### Why It Works Well:
- AdamW combines the benefits of Adam (adaptive learning rates) and weight decay regularization, improving convergence and generalization.
- Fine-tuning only the LoRA parameters ($A $ and $B $) reduces memory usage and speeds up training compared to fine-tuning the entire model.

### 4. **Batch Processing**

#### Mathematical Description:
- Batch processing allows the computation of gradients for multiple samples simultaneously, improving efficiency.
- For a batch size $B $, the input tensor has shape $[B, L] $, where $L $ is the sequence length.
- The model computes logits $\hat{y} $ for each token in the batch:
  $$
  \hat{y} = \text{Model}(x; \theta)
  $$
- The loss is averaged over the batch:
  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{B}}(\theta) = \frac{1}{B \cdot L} \sum_{b=1}^B \sum_{t=1}^L \ell(\hat{y}_{b,t}, y_{b,t})
  $$

#### Why It Works Well:
- Batch processing leverages parallelism on GPUs, significantly speeding up training.
- Larger batches provide more stable gradient estimates, leading to smoother convergence.

### 5. **Loss Function**

#### Mathematical Description:
- The loss function used is typically cross-entropy loss for causal language modeling:
  $$
  \ell(\hat{y}_t, y_t) = -\log P(y_t | \hat{y}_t)
  $$
  where $\hat{y}_t $ is the predicted probability distribution over tokens at position $t $, and $y_t $ is the ground truth token.
- The total loss for a sequence is the average over all positions:
  $$
  \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \frac{1}{L} \sum_{t=1}^L \ell(\hat{y}_t, y_t)
  $$

#### Why It Works Well:
- Cross-entropy loss encourages the model to assign high probabilities to the correct tokens, making it suitable for language modeling tasks.
- By minimizing this loss, the model learns to predict the next token accurately.

### 6. **Device Management**

#### Mathematical Description:
- Moving the model and data to the GPU accelerates computation by leveraging parallel processing.
- Let $T_{\text{CPU}} $ and $T_{\text{GPU}} $ represent the computation times on CPU and GPU, respectively. Typically:
  $$
  T_{\text{GPU}} \ll T_{\text{CPU}}
  $$

#### Why It Works Well:
- Modern GPUs are optimized for matrix operations, which are central to neural network computations.
- Transferring data and models to the GPU ensures efficient use of hardware resources.
